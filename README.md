# Process Scheduling Algorithms

This repository contains a Python implementation of various preemptive process scheduling algorithms. The algorithms implemented are:

- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF) - Preemptive and Non-Preemptive
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin Scheduling

## Features

- **User Input:** Prompts for the number of processes, arrival times, and burst times.
- **Algorithm Selection:** Allows users to choose which scheduling algorithm to run.
- **Gantt Chart:** Displays a Gantt chart for the chosen scheduling algorithm.
- **Performance Metrics:** Calculates and displays average waiting time and average turnaround time for the processes.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```sh
   pip install prettytable
